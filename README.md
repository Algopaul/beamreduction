# Beam reduction

## Installation
To run the code, clone the repository, create and activate a virtual environment and run
```bash
pip install -e .
```
from inside this repo. Also ensure to have ffmpeg installed (brew install ffmpeg on MacOS)

Then run `python beamreduction/driver.py`. This creates 4 videos and 1 png-plot of the singular value decay.
